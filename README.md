## Description
The files in this repository create a Note Taker app that is deployed in heroku. It operates on the node.js runtime and utilizes the express.js package to establish a server and connect the front end of the website with a back end json database. When the user first opens the website, they are presented with a home page that features a "Get Started" button. When the user clicks that, they are sent to the /notes page where the user can create notes on the right hand side of the page and also see a list of previously saved notes. The user can create a new note by typing in the "Note Title" and "Note Text" sections of the /notes page and save it by clicking on the save icon that appears in the top right hand part of the screen when a new note is being written. The use can also bring up previous notes by clicking on the note title listed on the left hand part of the screen. There is a also a delete button next to each saved note that will allow the user to delete any notes they wish.
